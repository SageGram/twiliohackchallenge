# Requirements For Windows:
1. Make sure to use Powershell as your terminal
2. Initially, I used command prompt as my terminal but quickly learned Linux commands are not supported, therefore I moved on to work in the PowerShell terminal.

3. Commands I found that didn't work were 'ls' & 'cd'.

# Steps Taken to Send SMS Via Twilio API
1. Create a Twilio account
2. Get a Twilio phone number
3. Install Python
4. Install PIP  
5. Create a 'send_sms.py' file. This is where you will store the code for your app. I created my file in the visual studio code text editor
6. Return to the PowerShell terminal and run the send.sms.py. In order for your file to run succesfully you must be in the folder that contains the file.
7. If you follow the steps in the youtube video below your phone should receive a text from the Twilio phone number.
